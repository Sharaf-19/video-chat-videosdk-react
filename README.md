# VideoSDK for ReactJS
At Video SDK, weâ€™re building tools to help companies create world-class collaborative products with capabilities of live audio/videos, compose cloud recordings/TRMP/HLS, and interaction APIs.

## Prerequisites
Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following:
- **React** v16 or later
- **Node** v10 or later
- A **VideoSDK** account

## Running the Sample App
Follow these steps to set up and run the app on your device:

### Step 1: Clone the Repo
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sharaf-19/video-chat-videosdk-react.git
cd video-chat-videosdk-react # Navigate into the project directory
```

### Step 2: Generate a Token:

- Go to the VideoSDK dashboard: https://app.videosdk.live/signup.
- Sign up or log in to your account.
- Navigate to the "API Keys".
- Generate a new temporary token. Copy this token; you'll need it in the next step.

### 3. Configure the Environment File:**

Within the cloned repository, locate the .env file. Replace YOUR_TEMPORARY_TOKEN with the generated token from your account:

```bash
REACT_APP_VIDEOSDK_TOKEN="YOUR_TEMPORARY_TOKEN"
```

### 4. Install Dependencies:**

Install the project's dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

### 5. Launch the App:**

Start the application using npm:

```bash
npm start
```
This will compile the application and start a development server. Open your web browser and navigate to the address shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:3000) to view the application.
